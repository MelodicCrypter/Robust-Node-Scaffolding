This scaffolding is meant for backend stuff only. For an instance. if you want to create a Node application on the fly.

However, I have already included a more reliable and easy-to-use templating engine for express (express-es6-template-engine).
I have also added ##Bootstrap and ##FontAwesome. I already configured WebPack 4 for your frontend and backend bundles and 
included Babel as well.

Basically, if you use this you can start creating Node apps in just a few seconds.

Of course you can modify this to suit your application's needs.
